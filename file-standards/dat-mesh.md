# Description
The File is split into 3 parts:

## The Header
The header contains:
* signature: A 8 byte long magic value to identify the file
* version: The version of the file standard
* vertexCount: The amount of vertices that the file contains
* indexCount: The amount of indices the file contains

## The vertex array:
The vertex array is a continuous stream of Vertices exactly the length `vertexCount` defined in the header

Each vertex is composed of 3 vecs which defined the position, normal, and colour of the vertex, and a vec2d that represents the UV coordinates.
Vecs are defined as three 32-bit floats, each representing a dimensional coordinate.

## The index array:
The index array is a continuous stream of indices exactly the length `indexCount` defined in the header.
Each index is a 32-bit unsigned integer that corresponds to an index of the `vertexArray`.
